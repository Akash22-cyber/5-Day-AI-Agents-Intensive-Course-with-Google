# 🚀 My Journey: 5-Day AI Agents Intensive with Google

Hey there! 👋  
This repo is my personal log from the **5-Day AI Agents Intensive** hosted by **Google & Kaggle** — a crazy-good experience where I explored how AI agents actually *think, act, and collaborate*.

---

## 💡 What I Learned

### 🧩 Day 1 — Intro to Agents
- Understood what makes an AI agent different from a normal chatbot.  
- Learned how agents **plan, reason, and act** instead of just replying.

### 🧠 Day 2 — Tools & MCP
- Explored how agents can **use external tools & APIs** to get real work done.  
- Discovered the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** that helps agents “talk” to tools easily.

### 🧬 Day 3 — Context & Memory
- Built agents that actually **remember** past interactions.  
- Learned how short-term and long-term memory shape smarter responses.

### ⚙️ Day 4 — Agent Quality
- Learned how to **test, debug, and evaluate** agents like real systems.  
- Explored concepts like **observability, tracing, and feedback loops**.

### 🌐 Day 5 — From Prototype to Production
- Figured out how to deploy agents for real-world use.  
- Learned about **multi-agent systems** using the **Agent2Agent (A2A)** protocol — agents that collaborate with each other!

---

## 🧠 Big Takeaways
- Agents aren’t just chatbots — they’re **doers**, not just **talkers**.  
- **Context and memory** are the secret sauce for smart interactions.  
- **Quality and evaluation** matter more than just output.  
- The future is **multi-agent** — systems that work *together* to solve complex problems.

## 🎓 Why I Loved This Course
It wasn’t just about theory — it was about **building things that think**.  
Google’s codelabs + Kaggle’s community made it super easy to learn by doing.
